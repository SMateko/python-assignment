# Python Assignment

## Description
This Python program provides a comprehensive solution for data analysis and visualization tasks.
It includes modules for preprocessing CSV data, performing least squares regression on training data, 
selecting ideal functions, predicting function numbers for test data, and visualizing the results using Bokeh. 


## Features
+ **Least Squares Regression**: Utilizes the Least Squares Regression algorithm to fit a polynomial curve to the training data.
+ **Ideal Function Selection**: Selects ideal functions based on the fitted curves using least squares regression.
+ **Prediction**: Predicts function numbers for test data based on the selected ideal functions.
+ **Visualization**: Visualizes the results using Bokeh, providing clear and interactive plots for analysis.


## Installation
+ **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/SMateko/python-assignment.git

+ **Install the required dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
+ **Ensure you have the necessary input files**: train.csv, ideal.csv, and test.csv.
+ **Run the main script**: python ideal_function_selection.py
+ View the generated visualizations in the output files (ideal_functions.html, selected_functions_vs_test_data.html).

## Contributing
+ Fork the repository.
+ Create feature branch (git checkout -b feature/new-feature).
+ Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
+ Push to the branch (git push origin feature/new-feature).
